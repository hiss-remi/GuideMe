## Release Packages
### 64-bit & 32-bit
These are full releases with the Java Runtime and VLC dependencies included. They are slightly larger, but should
always run regardless of if you have Java or VLC installed on your machine.
If you aren't sure which file to choose, use one of these.

### Slim
This contains only the GuideMe application and requires both Java and VLC to be installed on your machine.
If you already have these installed, this package is significantly smaller.
You can use either 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Java and VLC, but they **MUST** both be the same.
If you're having trouble with this package, verify your Java and VLC installations are both 64-bit or both 32-bit
or use one of the full releases that include these dependencies.
